// Your job is to implement the entire filesearchshell.cc
// functionality. We're essentially giving you a blank screen to work
// with; you need to figure out an appropriate design, to decompose
// the problem into multiple functions or classes if that will help,
// to pick good interfaces to those functions/classes, and to make
// sure that you don't leak any memory.
//
// Here are the requirements for a working solution:
//
// The user must be able to run the program using a command like:
//
// ./filesearchshell ./foo.idx ./bar/baz.idx /tmp/blah.idx [etc]
//
// i.e., to pass a set of filenames of indices as command line
// arguments. Then, your program needs to implement a loop where
// each loop iteration it:
//
// (a) prints to the console a prompt telling the user to input the
// next query.
//
// (b) reads a white-space separated list of query words from
// std::cin, converts them to lowercase, and constructs
// a vector of c++ strings out of them.
//
// (c) uses QueryProcessor.cc/.h's QueryProcessor class to
// process the query against the indices and get back a set of
// query results. Note that you should instantiate a single
// QueryProcessor object for the lifetime of the program, rather
// than instantiating a new one for every query.
//
// (d) print the query results to std::cout in the format shown in
// the transcript on the hw3 web page.
//
// Also, you're required to quit out of the loop when std::cin
// experiences EOF, which a user passes by pressing "control-D"
// on the console. As well, users should be able to type in an
// arbitrarily long query -- you shouldn't assume anything about
// a maximum line length. Finally, when you break out of the
// loop and quit the program, you need to make sure you deallocate
// all dynamically allocated memory. We will be running valgrind
// on your filesearchshell implementation to verify there are no
// leaks or errors.
//
// You might find the following technique useful, but you aren't
// required to use it if you have a different way of getting the
// job done. To split a std::string into a vector of words, you
// can use a std::stringstream to get the job done and the ">>"
// operator. See, for example, "gnomed"'s post on stackoverflow for
// his example on how to do this:
//
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/236129/c-how-to-split-a-string
//
// (Search for "gnomed" on that page. He uses an istringstream, but
// a stringstream gets the job done too.)
//
// Good luck, and write beautiful code!
